A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.
There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql etc.

Advantage of Java Package :
1) Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.
2) Java package provides access protection.
3) Java package removes naming collision.
4) It helps to remove ambiguity in case where more than one developer is working on a project.

There are three ways to access the package from outside the package :
1. import package.*; //// in this Subpackages is not accessible.
2. import package.classname;
3. fully qualified name. //// e.g. pack.A obj = new pack.A();

How to send the class file to another directory or drive?
To Compile: e:\sources> javac -d c:\classes Simple.java
To Run:     e:\sources> set classpath=c:\classes;.;
            e:\sources> java mypack.Simple
Another way to run this program by -classpath switch of java:
e:\sources> java -classpath c:\classes mypack.Simple



**** NOTE: If you import a package, subpackages will not be imported.
