else            - Used in conditional statements
enum            - declares  an enumerated (unchangeable) type
exports         - exports a package with a module. (New in Java 9)
extends         - extends a class (Used in inheritance)
final           - Used with exceptions , a block of code that will be exceuted no matter if there is an exeception or not.

for             - create a for loop
goto            - ************NOT IN USE AND HAS NO FUNCTION*************
if              - makes a conditional statement
implements      - implements an interface
import          - used to import a package , class or interface
instanceof      - Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface.
int             - a data type -2^31 to 2^31-1
interface       - used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods
long            - a data type -2^63 to 2^63-1
module          - declares a module (New in Java 9)
native          - specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file.
new             - creates new objects
package         - declares a package 
private         - an access modifier used for attributes , methods and constructors making them only accessible within the declared class.
protected       - an access modifier used for attributes ,methods and constructors making them accessible in the same package and subclasses.
public          - an access modifier used for classes, attributes ,methods and constructors making them accessible by any other class
requires        - specifies required libraries inside a module .
return          - finished the execution of a method and can be used to return a value from a method 
short           - a data type that can store -2^15 to 2^15-1
static          - a non-access modifier used for methods  and attributes . Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class

synchronized    - a non-access modifier which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time.
this            - refers to the current object in a method or constructor
throw           - creates a custom error 
throws          - indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method
transient       - a non-access modifier , which specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state
try             - creates a try....catch statement
var             - declares a variable (New in Java 10)
void            - specifies that a method should not have a return value
volatile        - indicates that an attribute is not cached thread locally and is always read from the main memory
while           - create a while loop
