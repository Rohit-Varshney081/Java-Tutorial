HttpSession interface
    1. We can bind the objects on HttpSession instance and get the objects by using
    setAttribute and getAttribute methods.
    2. In such case, container creates a session id for each user.
    3. The container uses this id to identify the particular user.
    4. An object of HttpSession can be used to perform two tasks:
    o bind objects
    o view and manipulate information about a session, such as the session identifier, creation
    time, and last accessed time

How to get the HttpSession object ?

The HttpServletRequest interface provides two methods to get the object of HttpSession:

    public HttpSession getSession():Returns the current session associated with this request, or if the request does not have a session, creates one.
    public HttpSession getSession(boolean create):Returns the current HttpSession associated with this request or, if there is no current session and create is true, returns a new session.

Commonly used methods of HttpSession interface

    public String getId():Returns a string containing the unique identifier value.
    public long getCreationTime():Returns the time when this session was created, measured in milliseconds since midnight January 1, 1970 GMT.
    public long getLastAccessedTime():Returns the last time the client sent a request associated with this session, as the number of milliseconds since midnight January 1, 1970 GMT.
    public void invalidate():Invalidates this session then unbinds any objects bound to it.
