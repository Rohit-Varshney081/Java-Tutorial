RequestDispatcher in Servlet :
    The RequestDispatcher interface provides the facility of dispatching the request to another resource it may be html, servlet or jsp. 
    This interface can also be used to include the content of another resource also. 
    It is one of the way of servlet collaboration. 

There are two methods defined in the RequestDispatcher interface.
Methods of RequestDispatcher interface :

    public void forward(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)throws ServletException,java.io.IOException:
    Forwards a request from a servlet to another resource (servlet, JSP file, or HTML file) on the server.

    public void include(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)throws ServletException,java.io.IOException:
    Includes the content of a resource (servlet, JSP page, or HTML file) in the response.


SendRedirect in servlet :
    The sendRedirect() method of HttpServletResponse interface can be used to redirect response to another resource, it may be servlet, jsp or html file.
    >>>> It accepts relative as well as absolute URL.
    >>>> It works at client side because it uses the url bar of the browser to make another request. So, it can work inside and outside the server. 


Difference between forward() and sendRedirect() method

There are many differences between the forward() method of RequestDispatcher and sendRedirect() method of HttpServletResponse interface. They are given below:

forward() method	                                                        |       sendRedirect() method
----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------
The forward() method works at server side.	                                |      The sendRedirect() method works at client side
It sends the same request and response objects to another servlet.          |   	It always sends a new request.
It can work within the server only.                                         |   	It can be used within and outside the server.
Example: request.getRequestDispacher("servlet2").forward(request,response); |  	Example: response.sendRedirect("servlet2");
